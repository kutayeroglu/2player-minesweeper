This VHDL code demonstrates a 2 player version of minesweeper (video game) on a SPARTAN 3A/3AN FPGA board.
There are two modes. 1st for placing mines 2nd for playing the game. At first mode a 3-bit input is taken from the user 
to put a mine to 1 of 8 displays. At second mode if player fails to guess where the mine is "lose" is displayed on the 
display. If user guesses a spot correctly lights of the area is shut down. When there is one spot left, also the same 
area with the mine, "success" is shown on the display. 


ONLY POWER SWITCH MUST BE ON BEFORE STARTING THE GAME

PLAYER 1 RULES
1. MODE PIN SHOULD BE DOWN! (P78)
2. YOU SHOULD FIRST SELECT A 3-BIT BINARY NUMBER WITH P5 P12 P15. P15 BEING THE LEAST SIGNIFICANT AND P5 BEING THE MOST. 
PLACEMENT RULES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
-	IF 001 IS SELECTED 2ND RIGHTMOST DISPLAY IS SELECTED 
(INPUT’S VALUE IN BASE 10) + 1 = COLUMNS PLACE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT 
3. WITHOUT TURNING DOWN THE SELECTED PINS USER MUST TRIGGER HIT BUTTON (P82)
--YOUR CHOICE IS SAVED!—
*IF YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE THE PLACE OF YOUR MINE, YOU CAN TURN DOWN HIT BUTTON RE-SELECT YOUR 3-BIT INBUT AND TRIGGER AGAIN.
4.TURN DOWN THE TRIGGER BUTTON THEN SET ALL COLUMN PINS (P5 P12 P15) TO ZERO. ORDER IS IMPORTANT.
--YOUR MINE IS PLACED!—
